### Database Structure Notes

* The ER diagram outlines the relationships between key entities such as `PLAYER`, `PITCH`, `GAME`, and `TEAM`.
* Each `PITCH` involves three players: the pitcher, batter, and catcher. Ensure APIs return details for all involved players when querying pitch data.
* The `daily_game_number` in the `GAME` entity helps identify doubleheaders. API endpoints should allow filtering by this field.
* Some fields, such as `pitcher_set` and `tagged_pitch_type`, currently have undefined values. Future updates should focus on clarifying their data types and existence.
* All unspecified measurement data types in the PITCH diagram are assumed to be `double precision`.
* Further investigation is needed for fields like `dimensions` in the `BALLPARK` table.
